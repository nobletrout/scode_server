# scode_server
## what is is?
A shell script based webserver
## when should I use it?
This should never be used.
## How do it work?
Using only the power of bash, implement a multi-hosted website. Make sure to abuse the power of emebedded base64 images to make your website complete. I also suggest gzipping the site and adding that as a header.

## details and aduedendums
Once again, don't use this code. But if you must, you should probably change your listening port so that sudo isn't needed.

maps two hosts to site1 and site2

put your website into files site1.bytes and site2.bytes. Or change shellcode. Or do what you do.
