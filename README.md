# scode_server
shell code based webserver

This should never be used.

Using only the power of bash, implement a multi-hosted website. Make sure to abuse the power of emebedded base64 images to make your website complete. I also suggest gzipping the site and adding that as a header.


Once again, don't use this code. But if you must, you should probably change your listening port so that sudo isn't needed.

maps two hosts to site1 and site2

put your website into files site1.bytes and site2.bytes. Or change shellcode. Or do what you do.
